# Employee Tracking System

## Overview
The Employee Tracking System is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API for managing employees, departments, and projects within an organization. It includes role-based access control (RBAC) and caching for improved performance.

---

## Features
1. **Department Management**
    - View, add, update, and delete departments.
    - Retrieve projects by department.

2. **Employee Management**
    - View, add, update, and delete employees.
    - Search employees by name, email, or department.

3. **Project Management**
    - View, add, update, and delete projects.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    - Restrict API access based on user roles (ADMIN, MANAGER).

5. **Caching**
    - Cache employee data and search results for better performance.

## Role-Based Access Control
- **ADMIN**: Full access to all APIs.
- **MANAGER**: Limited access based on department and employee restrictions.

---

## Caching
- **Caching Implementation**: Uses Spring Cache.
- Cached Entities:
    - All employees.
    - Individual employees by ID.
    - Employee search results.

---

## Prerequisites
1. Java 17+
2. Gradle
3. Spring Boot 3+
4. Database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL)
5. Spring Security for RBAC
6. Spring Cache for caching.
